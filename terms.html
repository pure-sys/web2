<h1>Terms & Conditions</h1>
<p>These terms and conditions apply to the mobile games (hereby referred to as "Applications") provided by LCVA LLC (hereby referred to as "Service Provider") as Freemium services.</p>

<h2>Acceptance of Terms</h2>
<p>Upon downloading or utilizing the Applications, you are automatically agreeing to the following terms. It is strongly advised that you thoroughly read and understand these terms prior to using the Applications. Unauthorized copying, modification of the Applications, any part of the Applications, or our trademarks is strictly prohibited. Any attempts to extract the source code of the Applications, translate the Applications into other languages, or create derivative versions are not permitted. All trademarks, copyrights, database rights, and other intellectual property rights related to the Applications remain the property of the Service Provider.</p>

<h2>Modifications and Charges</h2>
<p>The Service Provider is dedicated to ensuring that the Applications are as beneficial and efficient as possible. As such, they reserve the right to modify the Applications or charge for their services at any time and for any reason. The Service Provider assures you that any charges for the Applications or their services will be clearly communicated to you.</p>

<h2>Data Collection and Security</h2>
<p>The Applications store and process personal data that you have provided to the Service Provider in order to provide the Service. It is your responsibility to maintain the security of your phone and access to the Applications. The Service Provider strongly advises against jailbreaking or rooting your phone, which involves removing software restrictions and limitations imposed by the official operating system of your device. Such actions could expose your phone to malware, viruses, malicious programs, compromise your phone's security features, and may result in the Applications not functioning correctly or at all.</p>

<h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
<p>Please note that the Applications utilize third-party services that have their own Terms and Conditions. Below are the links to the Terms and Conditions of the third-party service providers used by the Applications:</p>

</ul>

<h2>Responsibility for Application Use</h2>
<p>The Service Provider does not assume responsibility for certain aspects. Some functions of the Applications require an active internet connection, which can be Wi-Fi or provided by your mobile network provider. The Service Provider cannot be held responsible if the Applications do not function at full capacity due to lack of access to Wi-Fi or if you have exhausted your data allowance.</p>
<p>If you are using the Applications outside of a Wi-Fi area, please be aware that your mobile network provider's agreement terms still apply. Consequently, you may incur charges from your mobile provider for data usage during the connection to the Applications, or other third-party charges. By using the Applications, you accept responsibility for any such charges, including roaming data charges if you use the Applications outside of your home territory (i.e., region or country) without disabling data roaming. If you are not the bill payer for the device on which you are using the Applications, you assume that you have obtained permission from the bill payer.</p>

<p>The Service Provider cannot always assume responsibility for your usage of the Applications. For instance, it is your responsibility to ensure that your device remains charged. If your device runs out of battery and you are unable to access the Service, the Service Provider cannot be held responsible.</p>

<h2>Updates and Changes</h2>
<p>The Service Provider may wish to update the Applications at some point. The Applications are currently available as per the requirements for the operating system (and for any additional systems they decide to extend the availability of the Applications to) may change, and you will need to download the updates if you want to continue using the Applications. The Service Provider does not guarantee that it will always update the Applications so that they are relevant to you and/or compatible with the particular operating s
